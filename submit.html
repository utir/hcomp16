                        HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on crowdsourcing and human computation. 
			While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in inviting, fostering, and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. 
                        This field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon, and contributes to, ranging from human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, to computer science and artificial intelligence, economics and the social sciences, all the way to cultural heritage, digital humanities, ethics, and policy. 
			The HCOMP conference is aimed at promoting the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing among not only researchers, but also engineers and practitioners, to encourage dialogue across a spectrum of disciplines and communities of practice.
			</p> 
<p class="lead">
HCOMP 2016 builds on a successful history of <a class="theme-link" href="past%20meetings.html">past meetings</a>: 
three HCOMP conferences (2013-2015) and four earlier workshops, held in conjunction with the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011-2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009-2010). Proceedings from past HCOMP conferences are available online in the <a class="theme-link" href="https://www.aaai.org/Library/HCOMP/hcomp-library.php">HCOMP Conference Digital Archive</a>.

The theme for HCOMP 2016 is <b>Interaction</b>:
<ul class="lead">
<li>between people and technology that is foundational to human computation
<li>between theoretical foundations, experimental work, and engineering
<li>between the computational, scientific, and social applications of crowdsourcing
<li>between diverse disciplines and perspectives, within our community and beyond

<p class="lead">
<b>Topics of Interest</b>. HCOMP strongly believes in inviting, fostering, and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research on crowdsourcing and human computation. 
Submissions may present principles, studies, and/or applications of systems that rely on programmatic interaction with crowds, or where human perception, knowledge, reasoning, or physical activity and coordination contributes to the operation of computational systems, applications, or services. 
More generally, we invite submissions from the broad spectrum of related fields and application areas including (but not limited to): 
<ul class="lead">
<li><mark>human-centered crowd studies</mark>: e.g., human-computer interaction, social computing, design, cognitive and behavioral sciences (psychology and sociology), management science, economics, policy, ethics, etc.
<li><mark>applications and algorithms</mark>: e.g., computer vision, cultural heritage, databases, digital humanities, information retrieval, machine learning, natural language (and speech) processing, optimization, programming languages, systems, etc.
<li><mark>crowdsourcing areas</mark>: e.g., citizen science, collective action, collective knowledge, crowdsourcing contests, crowd creativity, crowd funding, crowd ideation, crowd sensing, distributed work, freelancer economy, open innovation, microtasks, prediction markets, wisdom of crowds, etc.
</ul>


<p class="lead"><b>Review criteria.</b> Reviewers will be instructed to evaluate paper submissions according to specific <a class="theme-link" href="http://www.humancomputation.com/2016/review-criteria.html">review criteria</a>, 
some of which is unique to HCOMP 2016. Our intent in posting these review criteria online is to further improve transparency of the 
conference's peer-review process and to provide additional guidance to authors in preparing their submissions. We encourage
authors to review these criteria and contact us with any questions or feedback.
</p>

<p class="lead">
To ensure relevance, submissions are encouraged to include research questions and contributions of broad interest to crowdsourcing and human computation, as well as discuss relevant open problems and prior work in the field. 
When evaluation is conducted entirely within a specific domain, authors are encouraged to discuss how findings might generalize to other communities and application areas using crowdsourcing and human computation.

                    <p class="lead">
			The broad utility and impact of crowdsourcing and human computation have led to widespread interest from researchers spanning many different academic disciplines and domains of study. As part of this diversity, some researchers publish in journals, some in conferences, and others write books. In addition, researchers must often make tough decisions about where to publish work that would be welcomed in multiple venues. When related research is being published in many different forms and venues, it can be difficult to stay abreast of the latest, important research findings. To help remedy this, the Encore Track was created to provide a common forum to bring together such diverse researchers. By inviting previously-published work for encore presentation at HCOMP, we seek to foster further interactions among researchers and further broaden the dissemination and impact of important work in the field.
		    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
			We invite submission of recently published, high-quality research papers for encore presentation at HCOMP. Submissions must have been published, in-press, or accepted for publication since November 2015 in a well-known scholarly venue (i.e., journal, conference, book chapter, etc.). All authors of accepted papers will be invited to present a poster during the main conference, while particularly noteworthy work may be invited for oral presentation. Authors wishing to be considered for oral presentation only may specify this in the submission form. A link to the (official, copyrighted version) of the previously published version of any accepted paper will be posted on the conference website, and author and paper details will be included in the official conference program.   
		    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <b>Review</b>. Because papers have already been peer-reviewed for prior publication, authors will receive acceptance decisions without any additional peer-reviews. Acceptance decisions will consider not only the merit of the individual submission, but also its relation to other accepted papers in terms of bringing additional diversity to the overall conference. As a result, we stress that high-quality submissions may be declined due to no fault of their own, but rather due to overall needs of the conference in creating a highly-diverse program for conference attendees.

                    <p class="lead">
                        <b>Submission</b>. Please upload a copy of your previously published paper in PDF file-format to <a class="theme-link" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hcomp2016">EasyChair</a>, specifying the Encore Track. Please also copy-and-paste the official URL for the paper (i.e., to the publisher's copy on their website, not the author's personal copy) into the the Abstract field on the submission form. If the paper has only been accepted for publication but is not in-press or published (i.e., its publication cannot be verified by publisher URL), please upload a PDF file providing evidence of the paper's acceptance in the Supplemental Materials field on EasyChair.

		    <b>Works-in-Progress</b>. We encourage practitioners and researchers to submit <i>Works-in-Progress</i> as it provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early-stage work, and fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues. Accepted submissions will be presented as a poster at the conference and made available to the community as a two-page poster abstract. A <i>Work-in-Progress</i> is a concise report of recent findings or other types of innovative or thought-provoking work relevant to the HCOMP community. The difference between Works-in-Progress and other contribution types is that Work-in-Progress submissions represents work that has not reached a level of completion that would warrant the full Refereed selection process. That said, appropriate submissions should make some contribution to the body of HCOMP knowledge, whether realized or promised. A significant benefit of a Work-in-Progress derives from the discussion between the author and conference attendees that will be fostered by the face-to-face presentation of the work. Each WIP poster will be provided a 30"x40" poster board and thumb tacks to hang your poster; make sure to print your poster ahead of time according to these dimensions.<br/><br/>

		    <b>Demonstrations</b>. A demonstration is a high-visibility, high-impact forum of the HCOMP program that allows you to present your hands-on demonstration, share novel interactive technologies, and stage interactive experiences. We encourage submissions from any area of human computation and crowdsourcing. Demo promotes and provokes discussion of the role of technology, and invites contributions from industry, research, the arts and design. Demonstrations will showcase this year's most exciting crowd and human computation prototypes and systems. If you have an interesting prototype, system, exhibit or installation, we want to know about it. Sharing hands-on experiences of your work is often the best way to communicate what you have created.<br/><br/>

		    <b>Previously unpublished</b>. All submitted papers must represent original work, not previously published or under simultaneous peer-review for any other peer-reviewed, archival conference or journal.</br></br>
		    
                    <b>Length</b>. Works-in-Progress &amp; Demonstration papers can be up to 2 pages (<b>excluding</b> references), plus unlimited reference pages, may be submitted.<br/><br/> 
	
	            <b>Formatting</b>. All papers must be formatted according to the conference's <a class="theme-link" href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">style guidelines</a>. An <a class="theme-link" href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit16.zip">Author Kit</a> is available for getting started with LaTeX or Word.</br></br>

		    <b>Supplemental Materials</b>. Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as executables and data files so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper, images, additional videos, related papers, more detailed explanations, derivations, or results. These materials will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers, who are only obligated to read your paper itself.</br/><br/>

                    <b>NOT Anonymized</b>. Authors should include information identifying themselves and their institutions for single-blind review.<br/><br/>

                    <b>NOT Archival</b>. Accepted papers will NOT be included in official conference proceedings, and so may be submitted later to other conferences or journals for official publication.</p>
